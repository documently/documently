# documently

A comprehensive framework for building fast websites. documently transforms a directory of HTML templates, plaintext files, and assets into a parallel directory of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Forget plugins and starter kits, documently has everything you need to build blazing fast websites from static files.

## Beliefs

* **Comprehensive** &rarr; Everything you need to build a fairly standard website is included out of the box, without needing to install or configure a set of third-party tools
* **Opinionated** &rarr; Questions that typically might be left to the developer are instead answered by the framework. Instead of third-parties needing to come up with their own solutions ("starter kits"), if something is useful, it ends up in the framework
* **Minimal Configuration** &rarr; Most things are set up by default to work in a useful, unsurprising way; however, in some cases, breaking out of the typical patterns is possible
* **For Websites** &rarr; documently is not just another SPA serializer. Instead, it encourages the developer to think in the terms of the web: pages, links, and external assets

## Features

* An incremental build system that means you never generate more of your site than you need to
* A [progressive enhancement plugin][supercharge] that makes your fast
  website *even faster*
* A build pipeline for documents and assets that includes transpilation, versioning, minification, and other optimizations
* A directory structure with sensible locations for all kinds of files
* Support for HTML templates with embedded Ruby snippets
* Support for transforming Markdown to HTML
* Template helpers to make generating links and dates easier
